Here is a simple, line-by-line explanation of the code in practical7.ipynb. This notebook is focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the NLTK library and also uses TF-IDF for converting text into numbers.

1. Download necessary NLTK resources
python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
These lines download tools needed for text processing:

stopwords: common words like "is", "the"

punkt: tokenizer for splitting text into words/sentences

wordnet: for lemmatization (getting root forms of words)

averaged_perceptron_tagger: helps in part-of-speech tagging

2. Define a paragraph
python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
para = "The Ellora Caves, located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, India, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site..."

6. Mistake line (downloading non-existent resource)
python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')  # ❌ This resource does not exist
Note: 'punkt_tab' is likely a typo or unnecessary.

7. Tokenize into sentences and access second one

12. Show stopwords
python
Copy
Edit
swords
Displays the stopwords.

13. Remove stopwords from the word list
python
Copy
Edit
x = [word for word in words if word not in swords]
Keeps only the important words (removes "is", "the", "are", etc.).

14. Show filtered words
python
Copy
Edit
x
Displays the words after removing stopwords.

15. Import stemming tool
python
Copy
Edit
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
Imports tool to reduce words to their stem (e.g., "working" → "work").

16. Create stemmer object
python
Copy
Edit
ps = PorterStemmer()
Creates an instance of the stemmer.

17. Example of stemming
python
Copy
Edit
ps.stem('working')
Stems the word "working" → "work"

18. Stem all filtered words
python
Copy
Edit
y = [ps.stem(word) for word in x]
Applies stemming to each word in the list.

19. Show stemmed words
python
Copy
Edit
y
Displays all stemmed words.

20. Import lemmatizer
python
Copy
Edit
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
Prepares to use a more advanced root-finding tool (lemmatizer).

21. Create lemmatizer object
python
Copy
Edit
wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
Creates an instance of the lemmatizer.

22. Lemmatize "working" as a verb
python
Copy
Edit
print(wnl.lemmatize('working', pos='v'))
Reduces "working" to "work" using verb rules.

23. Download extra WordNet data
python
Copy
Edit
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
Needed for lemmatization to work properly.

24. Another lemmatize example
python
Copy
Edit
wnl.lemmatize('working', pos='v')
Same as earlier: gets root word "work".

25. Compare stemmer vs lemmatizer on "went"
python
Copy
Edit
print(ps.stem('went'))       # Output: "went"
print(wnl.lemmatize('went', pos='v'))  # Output: "go"
Shows stemmer keeps "went" as-is, but lemmatizer corrects it to "go".

26. Lemmatize all words
