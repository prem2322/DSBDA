1. import pandas as pd
This line loads the pandas library, which helps us work with tables (like Excel).

We use pd as a shortcut name for pandas.

2. df = pd.read_csv('iris.csv')
This reads a file named iris.csv and loads it into a table (DataFrame) called df.

3. df.shape
This shows the number of rows and columns in the table.

Example: (150, 5) means 150 rows and 5 columns.

#input data
x = df.drop('species', axis=1)
#output data
y = df['species']
x is the input — we remove the 'species' column because it's the result we want to predict.

y is the output — it contains only the 'species' column (the flower type).

5. y.value_counts()
This counts how many samples there are for each flower type (species).

#cross validation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
This imports a function to split our data into training and testing parts.

7.
python
Copy
Edit
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, random_state=0, test_size=0.25)
We split the data:

x_train, y_train: used to train the model (75%)

x_test, y_test: used to test it (25%)

random_state=0 makes sure we get the same split every time.

8. x_train.shape
Shows the size of the training input data.

9. x_test.shape
Shows the size of the test input data.

10. from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
We import a machine learning model called Naive Bayes.

11. clf = GaussianNB()
We create the model and call it clf.

12. clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
This trains the model using the training data.

13. y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)
This uses the model to predict the species for the test data.

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
These lines import tools to measure accuracy and show results like:

How many predictions were correct

Confusion matrix

Precision, recall, etc.

15. con_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
Creates the confusion matrix using the real and predicted values.

16. ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=con_mat).plot()
This shows the confusion matrix as a visual chart.

17. accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
Tells us the percentage of correct predictions.

18. clf.predict_proba(x_test)
Shows the probabilities for each possible class (species) predicted.

newl = [[4.5, 2.9, 3.1, 0.4]]
clf.predict(newl)[0]
Predicts the species for a new flower with given measurements.

Edit
newl = [[5.5, 3.1, 1.0, 0.8]]
clf.predict(newl)[0]
Another prediction for a different flower.

21. print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Prints a detailed report with:

Precision: how many predicted correctly

Recall: how many actual cases were found

F1-score: balance between precision and recall
